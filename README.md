This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common runtime error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug is caused by an off-by-one error in a for loop that iterates over an array. The solution involves correcting the loop condition to ensure that the loop does not attempt to access elements beyond the array bounds.  This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array indices in Java to avoid runtime exceptions.
